# How to Choose the Right Power Supply

Selecting the correct power supply ensures your LED lighting performs safely and efficiently. This guide will help you calculate power needs, understand voltage types, and make the right choice for your application.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Understand Your Load

Before choosing a power supply (PSU), you need to know the total power your system requires.

### 🔢 Power Calculation

> Formula:  
> **Total Power (W) = LED Strip Power per Meter × Total Length**

**Example:**
- LED strip: 14.4W/m  
- Length: 5 meters  
- `14.4W × 5m = 72W`

---

## 📈 2. Add a Safety Margin

Always choose a PSU with at least **20–30% headroom** above your calculated load. This helps prevent overheating and improves lifespan.

**Example:**
- Required power: 72W  
- Safety margin: 30%  
- `72W × 1.3 = 93.6W` → Choose a **100W PSU**

---

## 🔌 3. Match the Voltage

Your PSU voltage must **match your LED strip voltage exactly** (e.g., 12V, 24V, or 48V). Mixing voltages will damage your LEDs.

> **Tip:** Never use a 24V supply with a 12V strip (or vice versa).

---

## 🌡 4. Consider the Environment

Choose the right **IP rating** for your installation:

| Use Case        | IP Rating | Notes                        |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Indoors         | IP20      | For dry, ventilated areas    |
| Damp/Wet Areas  | IP65+     | For outdoor or humid use     |
| Industrial Use  | IP67/IP68 | High protection, rugged use  |

## 🔌 5. PSU Form Factors

Depending on where and how you'll install the PSU:
| Type         | Features                          | Example Use        | Example product |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Enclosed     | Ventilated metal case             | Cabinet installs   | <a href="https://vivalyte.com/product/vpsu-rsp-320-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPSU-RSP-320-24</a> |
| Waterproof   | Fully sealed, resin-filled        | Outdoor signage    | <a href="https://vivalyte.com/product/vpsu-hlg-40h-24a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPSU-HLG-40H-24A</a> |
| DIN Rail     | Mounts on standard DIN rails      | Electrical panels  | <a href="https://vivalyte.com/product/vpsu-ndr-480-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPSU-NDR-480-24</a> |
