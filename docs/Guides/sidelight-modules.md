# Sidelight Modules & Bars — Slim Signage Lighting Guide

Sidelight (edge-lit) modules and bars are designed to light signs **from the sides inward**, making them perfect for **ultra-slim lightboxes**, **fabric displays**, and **frameless signage**.

This guide covers:
- What sidelight systems are
- Module vs bar format
- Mounting directions and spacing
- Optical lensing and depth
- Power and planning advice

---

## 💡 What Are Sidelight Systems?

**Sidelight systems** are installed on the **edges** of the sign frame, projecting light **across the surface** rather than from behind.

They use:
- High-powered, narrow-beam LEDs
- Special lenses to throw light 500–1500mm
- Edge reflection and diffusion (especially in fabric systems)

---

## 🔠 Types of Sidelight Products

| Type               | Description                              | Best For                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Sidelight Modules** | Compact edge-mounted clusters          | Slim lightboxes &lt;80mm      |
| **Sidelight Bars**    | Rigid or extruded bar with LED array   | Large-format fabric boxes     |
| **Linear Edge Bars**  | Even spacing along aluminum bars       | Retail stretch frames         |
| **Asymmetric Lens Modules** | Long-throw beam shaping           | Wide signs from short edges   |

---

## 🔭 Beam Angles & Optical Design

Sidelight products rely heavily on **optical lenses** to spread light across the surface evenly.

| Lens Angle / Type     | Use Case                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 10&ndash;15&deg; Narrow Beam | Long throw from frame edge        |
| 30&deg; Elliptical         | Wide horizontal, narrow vertical    |
| Side-Firing 180&deg;     | Used for double-sided boxes          |
| Prism Lens              | Optimized for diffusion in textiles   |

> 🧠 **Tip:** Use a **diffuser fabric** or acrylic to blend light and eliminate hotspots near the LED source.

---

## 📏 Spacing & Depth Guidelines

| Lightbox Depth | Recommended Type         | Throw Distance (1 side) |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| 25&ndash;50mm   | Narrow-beam modules      | Up to 300mm              |
| 50&ndash;80mm   | Linear bars              | 400–600mm                |
| 80–150mm        | High-power side bars     | 700–1200mm               |

> 🔁 Double-sided lightboxes often use **back-to-back sidelight bars**, mounted on a central spine or at opposing edges.

## ⚙️ Voltage & Power Planning

| Voltage | Application Size     | Notes                             |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 12V     | Small signs           | High current, short runs          |
| 24V     | Standard fabric boxes | Most common, better efficiency    |
| 48V     | Large systems         | Long cables, less voltage drop    |

Typical Power:
- Modules: 1.0–2.5W each
- Bars: 6W–18W per bar (depending on length)

---

## 🛠 Mounting Techniques

| Type         | Mounting Method               | Notes                              |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Sidelight Bar | Screw or snap-in bracket     | Use aluminum extrusion for heat     |
| Module        | 3M tape or screw             | Aim lens across surface             |
| Double-sided  | Mount facing each side       | Needs structural center support     |

> 🧱 For fabric lightboxes, place modules/bars along the inside frame rails, and secure firmly to avoid sag or shift.

## 💧 IP Ratings

| IP Rating | Environment        | Use Case                         |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| IP20      | Indoor, dry        | Retail and textile frames        |
| IP65      | Humid environments | Bathrooms, semi-covered areas    |
| IP67      | Outdoor signage    | Must be sealed + UV protected    |

---

## 🎛 Control Options

- **PWM Dimming** — For brightness control
- **0&ndash;10V / DALI** — For building-integrated systems
- **DMX** — For creative zones or animated textile signs

---

## 🧠 Sidelight vs Backlight — Quick Comparison

| Feature        | Sidelight (Edge-Lit)         | Backlight (Rear-Mounted)          |
|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Depth Needed   | Low (25–80mm)                | Medium to deep (60–150mm+)        |
| Uniformity     | Requires good diffuser       | Easier to achieve with spacing    |
| Install Speed  | Faster for large boxes       | More setup for modules            |
| Parts Needed   | Fewer, but precise aiming     | More, but flexible layout          |

## 🧰 Example: 1.2 &times; 2m Fabric Lightbox

- **Frame Depth**: 60mm  
- **Type**: Single-sided textile  
- **Solution**:  
  - 2 × 24V side bars (mounted on vertical sides)  
  - 12W per bar  
  - Total power: ~24W  
  - Driver: 36W 24V with PWM dimming

> 💡 Add a light-blocking rear panel or foil to reduce back spill and increase forward intensity.

---

## 📦 Key Takeaways

✅ Use **edge-lit bars or narrow-beam modules** for:
- Textile lightboxes (retail, museum, décor)
- Slim acrylic lightboxes
- Double-sided fabric signage
- Large format frames (when used in pairs)

⚠️ Avoid sidelight for:
- Ultra-deep boxes (use backlight instead)
- Unstructured fabric frames (bar sag can occur)
