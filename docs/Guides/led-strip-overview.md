# LED Strip Lighting — Selection & Usage Guide

LED strips are one of the most versatile lighting tools available today — suitable for everything from signage and display lighting to architectural and decorative applications.

This guide breaks down:
- Different LED strip types and features
- Selection criteria (voltage, brightness, IP rating, etc.)
- Application tips and accessories

---

## 💡 Why Use LED Strips?

- Flexible, cuttable, and easy to install
- Available in various colors, voltages, and brightness levels
- Can be IP-rated for outdoor use
- Compatible with dimming and control protocols (PWM, DMX, SPI)

---

## 🧱 LED Strip Structure

Each LED strip consists of:
- **LED chips** (e.g., 2835, 2110)
- **PCB** (flexible or rigid, white/black/copper)
- **Resistors or IC drivers** (constant voltage or constant current)
- **Adhesive backing** for mounting
- Optional: silicone sleeve or extrusion for IP protection

---

## 🔠 Common LED Strip Types

### 🔹 Constant Voltage (CV)
- Driven at fixed voltage (12V / 24V / 48V)
- Simpler wiring, compatible with most drivers
- Brightness may drop over long runs (voltage drop)

### 🔸 Constant Current (CC)
- Maintains consistent brightness across long lengths
- Less affected by voltage drop
- Requires compatible CC driver or IC control

| 2216      | 2.2×1.6mm| High density | Linear effect, compact   |
| 2110      | 2.1×1.0mm| Super dense  | Great for dot-free effect|
| RGB       | Varies   | Color-mixing | Used in dynamic lighting |
| Digital   | Varies   | Individually addressable | DMX/SPI required |

## 🏗 PCB Width & Color Options

| Width (mm) | Usage                          |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| 5mm        | Narrow spaces, side-view strip |
| 8mm        | Standard applications          |
| 10mm       | Higher power strips            |
| 12mm+      | High current or RGBW strips    |

PCB colors:
- **White** – common, reflective
- **Black** – hidden installations
- **Copper** – premium heat dissipation

## 💧 IP Ratings

Choosing the correct IP rating ensures durability and safety in your lighting application. Below is a breakdown of general protection levels, followed by Vivalyte-specific LED strip configurations.

### 🔰 General Protection Levels


 | IP Rating   | Protection         | Use Case               |
 |-------------|--------------------|------------------------|
 | `IP20`      | None (bare PCB)    | Indoor dry areas       |
 | `IP65`      | Splash-proof       | Bathrooms, signage     |
 | `IP67/IP68` | Waterproof         | Outdoor, wet conditions|

 | `IP67 (WT)` | Silicone Tubing          | Fully sleeved, sealed ends              | ![IP67](/img/posts/WT.png) |
 | `IP67 (WHE)`| Heavy-Duty Sealing       | Outdoor tough, high resistance          | ![IP67 WHE](/img/posts/WHE.png) |
 | `IP68 (WE)` | Fully Waterproof         | Silicone extrusion with inner fill      | ![IP68](/img/posts/WE.png) |
 | `IP68 (WTS)`| Ultra Sealed Tubing      | Silicone tubing + silicone glue         | ![IP68 WTS](/img/posts/WTS.png) |
 | `IP68 (WTU)`| Rigid Waterproof         | Silicone + extrusion, outdoor use       | ![IP68 WTU](/img/posts/WTS.png) |

 > 🧠 *Tip: Choose IP64+ for any outdoor, dusty, or humid environments. IP68-rated strips are ideal for permanent outdoor installations, water features, and high-humidity areas.*

## ⚙️ Key Specs to Consider When Choosing

### Voltage
- **12V**: Good for short runs or lower power applications
- **24V**: Most common — better for medium-length runs
- **48V**: Great for long runs with minimal voltage drop

### Wattage / Brightness
- Ranges from ~4.8W/m to 20W/m+
- High lumen output strips available for task or architectural lighting

### Color Options
- **Single White**: 2700K – 6500K
- **Tunable White (CCT)**: Mix warm + cool
- **RGB / RGBW**: Full color effects
- **Digital Pixel Strips**: Individual LED control

---

## 🧰 Installation Tips

- Use **aluminum profiles** to manage heat and get clean finishes
- Always power strips **within rated length per feed**
- For long runs: **inject power** every 5–10 meters
- Match power supply voltage exactly (12V, 24V, or 48V)
- Use **PWM dimmers** or **DMX/SPI decoders** for advanced control

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using wrong voltage PSU → can damage the strip
- No heat management → reduces lifespan
- Overloading the PSU → causes flickering or failure
- Cutting strip at wrong place → makes that segment unusable
- Using indoor strips outdoors → moisture = 💀
