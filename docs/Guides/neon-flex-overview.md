# Neon Flex & LED Flex Guide

Neon Flex (also called LED Flex or Flexible Neon) is a modern alternative to traditional neon ‚Äî offering flexible, energy-efficient, and durable lighting for signage, architecture, and design.

In this guide, we‚Äôll explore:

- The 3 main types of LED flex based on **bending direction**
- Use cases, advantages & disadvantages
- Mounting tips and compatibility notes

## ‚û∞ 1. Types of Neon Flex

### üîπ **Front-Bend (Top-Bend)**

**Bends in the vertical direction** ‚Äî like folding a ribbon up/down.  
This type emits light from the **top** (flat surface).

| ‚úÖ Best For                     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Ideal For                |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Text signs, curves, vertical loops | Side-facing applications       |
| Wall lettering, channel letters    | Corners that bend sideways     |

---

### üî∏ **Side-Bend (Lateral-Bend)**

**Bends horizontally** ‚Äî like wrapping around a column.  
Emits light from the **side** surface.

| ‚úÖ Best For                        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Ideal For            |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Outlines, signs, edge lighting   | Vertical curves or loops    |
| Following letter contours        | Front-facing glow needed    |

---

### üü¢ **3D-Bend (Triaxial Flex)**

**Bends in both directions** ‚Äî horizontal and vertical.  
Some advanced types also **twist** slightly.

| ‚úÖ Best For                    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Ideal For         |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Complex shapes, logos, art   | Sharp corners or flat-only designs |
| Sculptural or architectural | Price-sensitive projects  |

## üß† Summary Table

| Type       | Light Direction | Bends       | Use Case Example       |
|------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Front-Bend | Top / upward     | Vertical    | Wall lettering, signage |
| Side-Bend  | Sideways         | Horizontal  | Edge outlines, curved signs |
| 3D-Bend    | Top / sides      | 3D flex     | Sculptural lighting, logos |

## ‚úÖ Advantages of LED Neon Flex

- **Durable:** Silicone/PVC casing is weather-resistant
- **Flexible:** Can follow complex curves and shapes
- **Low Voltage:** Safe and easy to power (12V or 24V)
- **No Glass or Gas:** Unlike traditional neon
- **Uniform Glow:** Dot-free light diffusion
- **Custom Cuttable:** Usually every 2.5‚Äì10 cm

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages

- **Limited Sharp Bends:** Can kink or damage if bent too tightly
- **Fixed Colors (in some types):** RGB/W not always available
- **Cut Restrictions:** Only cut at marked intervals
- **Dimming & Control:** Requires compatible drivers/controllers

---

## üîß Mounting & Compatibility Tips

- Use **mounting tracks** or **aluminum channels** for precise placement
- Always **test-bend** before installation to ensure fit
- **Avoid twisting** flex in unsupported directions
- **Check bend direction** before cutting or ordering
- Compatible with **DMX, SPI, or PWM** control depending on model

## üí° Popular Applications

| Application      | Flex Type       |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Channel letters  | Front-Bend      |
| Logo outlines    | Side-Bend       |
| Artistic installs| 3D-Bend         |
| Retail signage   | Front-Bend      |
| Cove lighting    | Side-Bend or Front-Bend |

## üì¶ Product Selection Notes

When choosing a Neon Flex model, consider:
- Voltage (12V vs 24V)
- Wattage per meter
- Color or RGB capability
- Bending direction
- IP Rating (indoor vs outdoor)
