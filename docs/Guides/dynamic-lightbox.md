# Dynamic Lightbox — Animated Signage & Fabric Backlighting

A **Dynamic Lightbox** is a modern evolution of traditional fabric signage. Instead of static white backlighting, it uses **programmable RGB or pixel-addressable LEDs** to create movement, fades, transitions, and fully animated content behind a textile or acrylic surface.

They’re widely used in:
- Retail and showroom displays
- Events and exhibitions
- Corporate environments
- Themed interiors or immersive experiences

---

## 💡 What Makes It "Dynamic"?

Unlike standard backlights or edge-lit systems, a dynamic lightbox uses **controllable LED sources** (like SPI or DMX strips or pixel bars) that can be individually addressed and animated.

Effects include:
- Color wipes, fades, and pulses
- Light-based transitions between images
- Multi-zone backlighting for storytelling
- Interactive response to music, sensors, or data

## 🔧 What’s Inside a Dynamic Lightbox?

| Component            | Function                                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Frame / Housing**  | Aluminum or stretch-fabric frame                |
| **Diffuser Surface** | Printed textile or fabric, rear-diffusing       |
| **Lighting System**  | RGB or RGBW pixel LEDs (bars or strips)         |
| **Control System**   | DMX, SPI, or custom controller with presets     |
| **Power Supply**     | Sized for pixel density and brightness          |
| **Optional Sensors** | Trigger effects (motion, audio, remote control) |

## 🧠 Pixel Control Technologies

| Protocol | Description                             | Use Case                          |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **DMX**  | Standard in lighting, 512 channels/control | Simple effects, integration with light desks |
| **SPI**  | Digital strip control (WS2812, UCS1903)   | High-res effects, mapped content  |
| **DALI / 0–10V** | Dimming only                     | Basic zones or fades              |

> 🧠 For mapped animations (video-to-light), SPI is often preferred. For synced scenes or lighting systems, DMX is ideal.

## 📏 Layout & Design Tips

| Frame Size        | LED Type          | Density                     |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| &lt; 1m&sup2;       | SPI pixel strips   | 30–60 LEDs/m                |
| 1&ndash;3m&sup2;     | SPI bars / matrix  | 16px x 16px or 32px x 32px  |
| 3m&sup2; +         | DMX zones / bar matrix | 8–16 zones w/ mapped wash  |

> Keep at least **50mm space** between fabric and LED source for good diffusion.

---

## 🎨 Content Creation

You can trigger effects using:
- Pre-programmed scenes (DMX desk or controller)
- Video files converted to pixel maps (via Madrix, Resolume, LED Edit, etc.)
- Timeline-based lighting control (e.g., QLC+, Artnet nodes)

> ✅ Tip: Use **gradient fades, wave motion, or brand-colored pulses** for subtle ambient animations.

---

## ⚙️ Power & Control Planning

- **Voltage:** Typically 5V or 12V for SPI, 24V for RGBW bars
- **Power Budget:** Allow 20–30% headroom
- **Pixel Mapping Software:** May require Artnet or E1.31 bridge
- **Controllers:** Advatek, T-1000S, Madrix, ENTTEC, etc.

---

## 🛠 Installation & Integration

✅ **Plan for**:
- Cable routing and ventilation
- Removable fabric face for servicing
- External access to controller (USB/DMX)
- Heat management (especially for dense SPI setups)

❌ **Avoid**:
- Overdriving pixels beyond frame depth
- Bare wiring in moving structures
- Under-diffusing (you’ll see LED dots!)

---

## 💧 Indoor Use Only (Usually)

Most dynamic lightboxes are **indoor-rated**, especially fabric systems. If you need **outdoor**:
- Use sealed LED bars (IP65+)
- Ensure textile is weather-resistant
- Protect the controller with an enclosure

---

## 🧰 Example System — Retail Animated Frame

- **Size**: 2m &times; 1.2m  
- **LED Type**: 12V SPI strip, 60px/m  
- **Layout**: 10 strips vertically  
- **Controller**: T-8000S with SD card  
- **Power**: 200W 12V PSU  
- **Fabric**: Backlit printed stretch with blockout rear layer  
- **Content**: 10s animated loop with fade + pulse

## 📦 Use Cases & Creative Ideas

| Industry       | Example                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Retail         | Animated branding or color mood |
| Automotive     | Logo reveals and motion washes |
| Trade Shows    | Timed product highlight pulses |
| Events         | Scene-driven or music-reactive |
| Hospitality    | Wall art that responds to time or sound |
