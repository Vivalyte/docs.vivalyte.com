# How to Connect a LED Strip to a Power Supply

This guide walks you through connecting a single-color LED strip to a constant voltage power supply safely.

## 🔧 What You’ll Need
- LED strip (12V / 24V)
- Matching PSU (e.g., 24V 100W)
- Screwdriver or WAGO connectors
- Optional: Dimmer (PWM or 0–10V)

## 📝 Steps
1. **Check the strip voltage** (printed on strip): e.g., 24V.
2. **Cut strip to length** at marked cut points (e.g., every 50mm).
3. **Wire the PSU:**  
   - Brown = Live (L)  
   - Blue = Neutral (N)  
   - Green/yellow = Ground (⏚)

4. **Connect the LED strip:**  
   - + (red) → V+  
   - – (black/white) → V–

5. **Turn on the power and test.**

> ⚠️ Always match voltage and add 20–30% headroom to your PSU.
